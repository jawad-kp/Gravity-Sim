# Gravity-Sim
The Gravity Simulation Mini-Project for CG

The project is demonstrates how gravity would act on a rigid body and encapsulates it's motion based of a range of parameters.<br>
It's designed in C++ with OpenGL and there has been extreme focus on making it as platform independent as possible.<br><br>

To run the project, download the release and open it in Visual Studio. It was previously compiled to `32 bit` to ensure maximum backwards compatability. Build and run it in Visual Sutdio. The Project, (comes packaged), requires `glut` libraries to be present and uses moslty primitives to compute a majority of it's functions. It has custom designed UI elements that simulate a text box and a label. All of which were designed using `glut`.

<br><br>
This project was built as a mini-project for VTU (CG-Lab) and meets all of its required specifcations.
